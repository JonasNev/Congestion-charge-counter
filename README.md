 Hello, welcome to my assignment. If you would take a minute to read this, it would be much appreciated.
 
 Code was written in VisualStudio in c# language. I have decided to use Razor as my tool, since it gives the ability to implement a simple UI in
 a very quick manner. 
 - Imput for date/time can be done using the UI when you launch the program OR changing lines 12-13 "startDate/endDate" in the "CounterController".

Thank you for reading. Further explanations will be found in the code itself.
